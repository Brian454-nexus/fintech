# ðŸš€ Render Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix for Your Render Deployment

The error you're seeing is due to dependency conflicts. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Use the Simplified Version (Recommended)

1. **Update your Render service settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app-simple.py`

2. **The simplified version includes**:
   - âœ… Working biometric enrollment (face & voice)
   - âœ… Fraud detection
   - âœ… All UI features
   - âœ… Mobile optimization
   - âœ… No heavy dependencies

### Option 2: Fix the Current Version

1. **Update Render settings**:
   - **Build Command**: `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel && pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `python app.py`

### Option 3: Use Railway Instead (Easier)

Railway handles dependencies better:
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Deploy automatically

## ðŸ”§ Render Configuration

### Service Settings:
- **Environment**: Python 3
- **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt`
